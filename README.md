# Low-Resolution-Bird-Image-Classification-AI-Competition

## Description
The provided code utilizes the EfficientNet-B0 model for a bird classification task. EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural networks known for their efficiency and high accuracy, achieved through a compound scaling method that uniformly scales network width, depth, and resolution. The code fine-tunes a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 model on a custom dataset of bird images, adjusting the classifier to match the number of classes in the dataset.

## Model Architecture
The EfficientNet-B0 model is based on the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck (MBConv) layers, similar to those in MobileNetV2, but with additional Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to enhance feature extraction. The model's architecture includes:

MBConv Layers: These layers use depth-wise separable convolutions followed by point-wise convolutions to efficiently process features.

SE Blocks: These blocks help the model focus on important features by applying channel-wise attention.

Compound Scaling: This method scales the network's width, depth, and resolution using a compound coefficient, allowing for efficient scaling without compromising accuracy.

In the provided code, the pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 model is modified by replacing its classifier with a custom one to fit the specific number of bird species classes:

```python
# Load pre-trained EfficientNet B0 model
model = models.efficientnet_b0(pretrained=True)

# Modify the classifier
num_ftrs = model.classifier[1].in_features
model.classifier = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.3),
    nn.Linear(256, 50)
)
```


## Competition Information
This model can be applied to competitions like the Dacon Low-Resolution Bird Image Classification AI Competition. The competition aims to develop AI algorithms that can classify bird species from low-resolution images (64x64 pixels). Participants are encouraged to design efficient models that can perform well under these constraints, contributing to biodiversity conservation efforts.

Improvements & Future Updates
Data Augmentation: Implementing additional data augmentation techniques, such as AutoAugment or RandAugment, could further enhance model performance by increasing the diversity of the training data.

Transfer Learning: The model is already using transfer learning by starting with a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0. However, experimenting with different pre-trained models or fine-tuning on other datasets could provide insights into the model's adaptability.

EfficientNet Variants: Exploring other EfficientNet variants (e.g., EfficientNet-B1 to B7) could offer better performance depending on the available computational resources and desired accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducting a thorough hyperparameter search (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) could optimize the model's performance on the specific dataset.

EfficientNetV2: Upgrading to EfficientNetV2 models, which offer faster training and better efficiency, might be beneficial for future updates.

## Conclusion
The code effectively utilizes EfficientNet-B0 for a bird classification task, leveraging its efficient architecture and high accuracy. By fine-tuning the model and adjusting its classifier, it demonstrates how EfficientNet can be adapted for specific classification tasks. Future improvements could involve exploring different EfficientNet variants, enhancing data augmentation strategies, and optimizing hyperparameters for better performance. This model can be useful in real-world applications such as low-resolution image classification.
